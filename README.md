ioutils
=======

A framework for unified access between various Java I/O classes, such as streams, channels, data inputs/outputs and byte buffers.
Also includes various helpers for NIO buffers and other frequently used I/O tasks.

Unit tests are still in developement, so consider the code as unstable and experimental. Use it at your own risk!
